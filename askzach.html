<p> Q: Can you make bread? </p>
<p> A: Dear B Peeler,

Actually, yes. I can make bread. Several varieties. Though come to think of it, I've never tried making banana bread. I guess I've just never quite known how to remove the outside part of the banana. Your name seems to suggest that you'd be able to help with that. Hit me up sometime.

<p> Q:  Dear Zach,
You seem like the kind of person that is so very wise and can be trusted. I'm going though a hard time in my current situation and could use some council. I am staying in an apartment complex and my neighbors tend to be very noisy in the late hours of the night. I have many early morning classes and sometimes I even have tests the next day. How can I deal with this trial?</p>

<p> A:  Dear Sleepless in Seattle,
  Aww, you flatter me. Y'know, I think yours is a common problem. Have you tried writing some passive-aggressive texts to the perpetrators? If not, don't. As they say, if you can't beat 'em, party even harder than they do until they join you. Which is essentially the same as beating them, now that I think of it. But when it comes to sleeping-have you tried using earplugs? They're more effective than a broomstick and cheaper than a lawsuit. Best of luck!

<p> Q: How do I talk to girls? </p>
<p> A: Dear Fearer of the Fairer Sex,

For this kind of anxiety, people often suggest imagining the audience in their underwear. Or maybe that's anxiety over public speaking? Whatever the case, I can't help but imagine that that would only serve to exacerbate the problem in your situation.

Have you tried using words? If successful with that step, consider moving on to sentences. You never know what a good sentence will do for you. If blessed with a response, continue to exchange sentences until the desired outcome is attained. Should you find that you have said something reprehensible, just remember-nobody thinks you sounded as stupid and vile as you do.

However, in extreme cases, it may be good to remember that that principle doesn't always apply to a jury of your peers. Best of luck, and keep out of trouble!

<p> Q: Hi Zach!

My mandolin is my only friend. How I improve my soloing over D mixolydian mode and a G blues scales?

Yours in nescience,
Tormented Tortilla </p>
<p> A: Dear Tormented Tortilla,

Ah, the age-old question. There's actually lots of helpful resources for this already up on the web. I recommend <a href="http://www.latlmes.com/music/record-record-breaking-jazz-solos-in-record-time-1"> this one </a> from the LA Times to start.

The key is to never give up!

-Zach
